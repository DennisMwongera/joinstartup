        "On this World Water Day We are very happy and excited to launch our new campaign AMRIT. Under this campaign, we will work on several issues related to water. It is going to be a very huge campaign covering a large number of masses and issues. As we know that groundwater pollution is one of the major problem especially in rural areas as they use groundwater directly for drinking and other household purposes without using any filters. And there are several toxic chemicals and impurities present in polluted groundwater which is a threat to humans as well as to flora and fauna. So, in this campaign the first task we would take on is to work on groundwater pollution. Groundwater is invisible, but its impact is visible everywhere. Out of sight, under our feet, groundwater is a hidden treasure that enriches our lives. Almost all of the liquid freshwater in the world is groundwater.As climate change gets worse, groundwater will become more and more critical.",

Groundwater needs to be used carefully and sustainably â€“ but we cannot manage what we do not measure. Groundwater must be thoroughly explored, analyzed and monitored. We are looking for innovative ideas from your side for this campaign.So if you have any please share with us. You can also share your real life experience, story, problem or anything of such kind marketplace groundwater pollution. We would also approach several places under our Mission to make clean water available for all by installing appropriate water treatment plans. So, if you have any place ( village, town or city) in your knowledge let us know. We would love to hear from you. We also proudly announce Together Ek Saath Foundation as our sponsor for this campaign. Join us in this campaign !!",
