        "Every village has a government school. They have teachers too. Shankrapur was no different. But it is no hidden fact that villagers and rural kids face the tragedy of having schools and teachers yet no education. The fact is dangerous as you realise what these little minds could have been but now it is all in despair due to crippling education system in the government schools. It plays a prominent role in all-around development of individual as well as society. Without education we are incomplete. Every child must go to school in his/her appropriate age as everyone has equal rights for the education from birth.",

        "We bought one room on rent in the same village and tried to give the children a few hours after they came from government schools. Even if they didn't enroll, they were allowed under this hut to study. The financial drawbacks made our class had not many segments. We used to club same age students together and make them study for 3-5 pm daily. This was a pilot basis thing but it took off really well. We soon dreamt of making a proper schedule.",
