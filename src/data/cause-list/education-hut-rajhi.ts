          "This is a new initiative started on 8 December 2019. This place is not merely a tution class but the collection of our dreams as we vowed in the start. We were able to make a second branch of our tution classes under shine education and welfare society and transform it into good for real. At education hut tution at Rajahein(Adarshnagar), we teach all students for free. They get the supplies, uniforms, bags, sweater other stationary under various functions and distribution days. The schedule goes parallel to the free time of the village kids after their basic primary school. We organise cultural functions and games too. We aspire to create a better future for the Rajaheen village and the adjoining villages. Since the education hut bears absolutely no burden of finance on the parents, even the poorest kids now get a chance to hold books and pencils in their hands.",
