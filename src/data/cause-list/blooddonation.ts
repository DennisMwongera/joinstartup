        "Our organization is very old, and we work for education and welfare. During covid, we started off as the situation unfolded. First, we did many awareness programs in rural areas with the help of respective S.H.O. Second, when there was a panic migration, we collaborated with community kitchen of Gorakhpur and served packed food at highway near Gorakhnath. Third, our volunteers worked day and night to get correct verified leads marketplace hospital, medicine, blood, oxygen cylinder etc. Fourth, being involved in verifying leads, we met several black marketers who were immediately warned and reported under cybercrime. Fifth, we distributed masks and sanitized the villages during second wave. All such works were done under the able leadership of our president Mr. Shamshad Alam. So, I would nominate him for directing the best work under our NGO in the city.",
