And there are several toxic chemicals and impurities present in polluted groundwater which is a threat to humans as well as to flora and fauna. So, in this campaign the first task we would take on is to work on groundwater pollution. Groundwater is invisible, but its impact is visible everywhere.

You can also share your real life experience, story, problem or anything of such kind marketplace groundwater pollution. We would also approach several places under our Mission to make clean water available for all by installing appropriate water treatment plans.
